This repository contains an example of a common error in Ada programming related to array indexing and exception handling. The `bug.ada` file demonstrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides a corrected version.  The original code attempts to double each element of an array; however, it lacks robust error handling and might lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
